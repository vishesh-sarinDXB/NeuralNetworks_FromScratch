# NeuralNetworks_FromScratch

This was a personal project I worked on for learning purposes.

It implements a shallow neural network from scratch (without tensorflow, but with numpy for mathematical operations, and sklearn for splitting data).

It uses Particle Swarm Optimization to train the network, and uses a randomized hyperparameter search.
